                    Hello! My name is Michael (but you can call me Mike), and I would like to welcome you to my portfolio page. Here is a bit about me: I was born in the year nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and a short thirty-four years later I decided I wanted to start a career in the tech industry as a software developer.
                    <br/> 
                    I started my coding journey by going through a foundational boot camp, learning a few programming tips & tricks over the course of sixteen weeks. After that I was lucky enough to find and be accepted on a software development apprenticeship at Trusted Technology, and that's where I am today!

                <h3>Innovative Solutions Hub</h3>

                <p>
                    One of my first projects in software development was the Innovative Solutions Hub, a web app which uses a Next.js front end and a .NET back end.
                    <br/> 
                    The app allowed users to input any problems they might have, and then queried a database of innovative solutions through an API to find the most suitable solution for the given problem. The project was so innovative that I actually made up some new words for it; for example, the word "Tetiimouials" can be seen in the screenshot above! What does it mean? Follow the link to find out.
                    <br/>
                    The app also boasts an impressive three Services tabs in the navbar.
