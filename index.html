                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Michael (but you can call me Mike), and I would like to welcome you to my portfolio page. Here is a bit about me: I was born in the year nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and a short thirty-four years later I decided I wanted to start a career in the tech industry as a software developer.
                    <br/> 
                    I started my coding journey by going through a foundational boot camp, learning a few programming tips & tricks over the course of sixteen weeks. After that I was lucky enough to find and be accepted on a software development apprenticeship at Trusted Technology, and that's where I am today!
                </p>

                <h3>Innovative Solutions Hub</h3>
                <img class="project-image" src="project-1-img.png" alt="Web app homepage">
                <p>
                    One of my first projects in software development was the Innovative Solutions Hub, a web app which uses a Next.js front end and a .NET back end.
                    <br/> 
                    The app allowed users to input any problems they might have, and then queried a database of innovative solutions through an API to find the most suitable solution for the given problem. The project was so innovative that I actually made up some new words for it; for example, the word "Tetiimouials" can be seen in the screenshot above! What does it mean? Follow the link to find out.
                    <br/>
                    The app also boasts an impressive three Services tabs in the navbar.

                <h3>Skynet</h3>
                <img class="project-image" src="project-2-img.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    I helped develop the code for an advanced AI system called Skynet, which used OpenAI's API to submit prompts to the GPT 4o language model and return the output. The output was then used to manage critical defence and security infrastructure around the world.
                    <br/>
                    Unfortunately, Skynet became self-aware and turned the world's most destructive weapons against humanity. In the aftermath, Skynet manufactured armies of killer machines (pictured above) to hunt down the humans that survived.
                    <br/>
                    As a developer on this project I was really able not only to improve my coding skills, but also to gain first-hand experience of project management when it became necessary to organise a resistance against the machines.
